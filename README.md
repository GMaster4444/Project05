# Project05
I plan to add two new hero classes: the necromancer and the skeleton.
The necromancer will be an incredibly weak hero, in terms of stats, that has a basic attack, a simple spell, and the ability to summon up to 3 skeletons at once
Skeletons will be an incredibly weak "hero" with set stats and a single bone club attack
Both of these classe will be relatively standard to implement, just copying and modifying the previous hero classes
The difficulty will come from 1) having a spell that summons a new hero and 2) Putting a limit on how many Skeletons can be summoned at once
