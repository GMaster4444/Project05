# Project05
I plan to add one new hero class: the necromancer.
The necromancer will be similar to the mage class, however their attacks will be bone themed.
These attacks will consist of a basic staff attack, a bone spike spell, and a life drain spell
This classe will be relatively simple to implement, just copying and modifying the mage hero classes
The difficulty will come from the life drain spell
